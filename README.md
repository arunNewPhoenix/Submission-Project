You can Also see my other Project which are deployed in Heroku and are fully Functional 

About me :During my ongoing college years mostly I used Django as framework for populating the frontend with the data fetched from the database using jinja format of the django
wrote models for the database as a DBA .This is my first time I am handling a frontend Project because I wanted to learn these too.(I believe I can learn from your organization and my personal effort)

My other one of the best Project: A Web-application :: Lemonade-an app for CS-nerds...
handled the database models and schema's
